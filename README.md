<p>Nowadays, COVID19 Testing And Record Management System is one of the most essential tools that are mostly used in Testing Lab; it is mostly used to manage COVID19 medical lab related activities.</p>
<p>In this project we tried to develop a computerized and web based COVID19 Testing And Record management system. Our main intention is to allow this application to be used in most retailing COVID19 lab, where a small point of customization will be required to each COVID19 lab in the implementation period. This system is designed to overcome all challenges related to the management of diagnostic that were used to be handled locally and manually.</p>

In COVID19 Testing Management System we use PHP and MySQL database. It has three modules i.e.
1. Admin
2. User (Patient) 

<strong>Admin Module</strong> 
<p>Admin is the super user of the website who can manage everything on the website. Admin can log in through the login page </p>
<p><strong>Dashboard:</strong> In this section, the admin can see all detail in brief like the total, assigned and the sample collected and completed tests. </p>
<p><strong>Phlebotomist:</strong> In this section, the admin can manage Phlebotomist (add, update, delete).</p>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong> In this section, the admin can manage all the tests like assign the test to Phlebotomist and update the history. </p>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> In this section, the admin can generate two types of report. One is between dates reports and another one is by search. Admin can search the report by order number, name and mobile number. </p>
<p><strong>Notification:</strong> In this section, the admin will get a notification for every new test request (notification bell).</p>
<p>Admin can also update his profile, change the password and recover the password. </p>

<strong>User (Patient) Module</strong> 
<p>User can visit the application through a URL. </p>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong> This section divided into two parts. One is for new user and another one is for registered user. New user (First-time user) needs to provide personal and testing Information. A registered user only needs to provide test information; their personal information will be fetched from the database. </p>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> In this section, Users can search their test report using order number, name and registered mobile number. </p>
<p><strong>Dashboard:</strong> In this section, the User can see the in which State of how many tests are done.</p>
